# Netflix-Analysis
DATS 6401 - Final Project - Michael Pagan

This project aims to visualize the Netflix habits of individuals and families in my social circle.

## About 
This project visualizes the Netflix viewing statistics from nine families within my social circle. The data were obtained using 
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-viewing-stats/bckfpnenhimfckndcceonmkhheinmkob?hl=en">Netflix Viewing Stats</a>, a
            Google Chrome extension that leverages Netflix's Shakti API (learn more <a href="https://github.com/oldgalileo/shakti)">here</a>) to
            allow users to get more out of Netflix's Viewing Activity page by creating a dashboard of the signed-in user's viewing statistics. From here,
            a .csv file can be downloaded to tabulate these data, which were then visualized. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows">Netflix Movies and TV Shows Kaggle dataset</a>
            were also used to compare viewing statistics to the Netflix library as of 2019. Data were pre-processed in Microsoft Excel and RStudio; visualized using Tableau and D3.js.
